My jupyterlab notebook with a variational autoencoder with residual connections and a custom energy loss, used in my Mgr thesis (which will be finished this autumn). 
I did not include both datasets, but I can provide them upon asking. The neural network needs to be trained on graphics cards or something very powerful.
