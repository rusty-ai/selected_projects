This is a small task, a book recommendation system made for an interview at DataSentics. The datasets are availabe at http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/
In the .ipynb, there is the data processing that resulted in all dataframes in the resources directory. Running the book_application starts a pyglet app with a simple UI, that recommends 4 new books to read to a user who inputs a single book he likes (and possibly his age and country of residence). Requires an internet connection in order to download book images. The app is controlled using arrow keys, ENTER to show results and text + backspace to write book/age/country information.
