My jupyterlab notebook with a variational autoencoder with residual connections and a custom energy loss, used in my Master's thesis (which will be finished this autumn). 
I did not upload the datasets (the size is around 7 Gb), but I can provide them upon asking. The neural network needs to be trained on graphics cards or something very powerful, inference might be possible locally.
