# selected_projects
A few selected projects demonstrating my Python programming skills as of August 2023

In mgr_thesis, there is a jupyter notebook with a variational autoencoder I was working on recently, in racetrack_game, there is an implementation of the square paper game Racetrack (with an AI opponent using a combination of A* and greedy search algorithms). In deep_learning_assignments, there are a few solutions to some tasks from the Deep Learning course on MFF UK I passed, and in intro_to_ML_assignments there are a few solutions to assignments from the Introduction to Machine Learning course on MFF UK I passed (the code there is not as polished as in some newer tasks, but it implements Naive Bayes, SVM, Kernel linear regression, etc., which I thought would be interesting). It was possible to work in teams of up to three people on those tasks, but the solutions included are for the most part my work.
